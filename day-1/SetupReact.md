# Daily React Learning

This README document outlines the steps to create and set up a React app for daily learning. Follow these instructions to get started with your React projects.

## Step 1: Initialize a GitHub Repository

1. Create a new GitHub repository to host your React projects.

## Step 2: Clone the Repository

2. Clone the GitHub repository in Visual Studio Code (VSCode) using HTTPS.

## Step 3: Set Up a React Project

3. Open the terminal in VSCode and run the following command to set up a React project using `create-react-app`:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
```

Make sure to use `npx` and not `npm` as shown in the image above.

## Step 4: Start the Development Server

4. Once the setup is complete, navigate to the app directory by using the following command:

```bash
cd my-app
```

Then, start the development server with the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

It should open a development server and look something like this:

## Step 5: Clean Up the Initial Code

5. Now, you can begin your project by cleaning up the initial code in the `<div>` element in the `App.js` file. Remove the default code and start fresh.

### Old Code:

## Step 6: View Your Local React App
6. Once you've made your changes, your browser should display your React app on `http://localhost:3000/`. If your screen appears differently due to a Chrome extension, don't worry; it's typically white.

Your React app is now set up, and you can begin building your project.

Feel free to add more details or explanations as needed to your README file. Happy coding!
